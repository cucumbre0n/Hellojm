          <h3>Update - April 2021</h3>
          <p>I'm going to be making some changes to the website. I'm adding and
            removing things, and changing up the design. </p>
          <p>Flash games don't work anymore as of 2021, so I removed the games
            page. I'll find something to replace it with soon.</p>
          <h3>Update 2</h3>
          <p>I'm not sure why the kittens page isn't working right now, but I'm working on fixing it.</p>
